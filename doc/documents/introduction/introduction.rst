Introduction
############

This is a handbook for ARC labs which is a part of ARC university courses.
The handbook is written to help students who attend the ARC university course.
Anyone interested in |arc| can also take this handbook as a quick start-up to get started in |arc| development.
In this handbook, all the basic elements of ARC are described in the labs with a step-by-step approach.

This handbook can be used as a Lab teaching material for ARC university courses at
undergraduate or graduate level with majors in Computer Science, Computer
Engineering, Electrical Engineering, or for professional engineers.

This handbook includes a series of labs (more labs will be added in the future), which are roughly classified into 3 levels:

* :ref:`Level 1: ARC basic <level1_labs>`

The labs in this level cover the basic topics of |arc|. For example, the
installation and usage of hardware and software tools, software or hardware
development kits, the first hello world example, interrupt handling and internal timers of |arc|, and so on.

* :ref:`Level 2: ARC advanced <level2_labs>`

The labs in this level cover the advanced topics of |arc|. For example,
Real-Time Operating System (RTOS), customized linkage, compiler optimization,
basic applications, |arc| DSP feature, and so on.

* :ref:`Level 3: ARC exploration <level3_labs>`

The labs in this level cover some complex applications of |arc|. For example,
Internet of Things (IoT) application, embedded machine learning, and so on.

Most of the labs are based on the `embARC Open Software Platform (OSP) <https://github.com/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/embarc_osp>`__ which is an open
software platform to facilitate the development of embedded systems based on
|arc|.

It is designed to provide a unified platform for |arc| users by defining
consistent and simple software interfaces to the processor and peripherals
together with ports of several well known Free and open-source software (FOSS)
embedded software stacks to |arc|.

For more details about |embarc|, please see its
`online docs <http://embarc.org/embarc_osp/>`__.

Supported Hardware Platform
