Introduction
############

This is a handbook for ARC labs which is a part of ARC university courses. It's written
to help students who attend the ARC university courses and anyone who is interested in |arc| to
get started in |arc| processor development. It describes all the basic elements of ARC labs and
how to finish the labs with step by step approach.

This handbook can be used as a Lab teaching material for ARC university courses at
undergraduate or graduate level with majors in Commuter Science, Computer
Engineering, Electrical Engineering; or for professional engineers.

This handbook includes 12 labs currently (more labs will be added in the future), which can be
classified into 3 levels:

* :ref:`Level 1: ARC basic <level1_labs>`

The labs in this level cover the basic topics about |arc|, e.g., the
installation of tools, hello world, interrupts, timers and so on.

* :ref:`Level 2: ARC advance <level2_labs>`

The labs in this level cover the advanced topics about |arc|, e.g., RTOS,
customized linkage, ARC DSP and so on.

* :ref:`Level 3: ARC exploration <level3_labs>`

The labs in this level will cover some complex applications about |arc|, e.g., IoT
application, embedded machine learning and so on.

Most of labs are based on the `embARC Open Software Platform (OSP) <https://github.com/foss-for-synopsys-dwc-arc-processors/embarc_osp>`__ which is an open
software platform to facilitate the development of embedded systems based on
|arc|.

It is designed to provide a unified platform for |arc| users by defining
consistent and simple software interfaces to the processor and peripherals,
together with ports of several well known FOSS embedded software stacks to
|arc|.

For more details about |embarc|, please refer its
`online docs <http://embarc.org/embarc_osp/>`__
