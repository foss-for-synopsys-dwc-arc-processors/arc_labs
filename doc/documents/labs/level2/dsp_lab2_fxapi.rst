ARC DSP: Using FXAPI
===============================

Part 1.	Prerequisites
---------------------

Before starting to use the ARC DSP, the following prerequisites are required:

* Make sure that the MetaWare tools for Windows installed

  `<https://www.synopsys.com/dw/ipdir.php?ds=sw_metaware>`_


* Lean how to create, edit, build, and debug projects in MetaWare IDE

* Make sure that the |iotdk| and Digilent USB drivers (Digilent Adept 2) installed and tested

  `<http://store.digilentinc.com/digilent-adept-2-download-only>`_

* |iotdk| is based on DSP-enabled core configuration EM9D

The following procedures need to be tested before this lab:

* Connecting |iotdk| to computer

* Connecting serial console (PuTTY) to |iotdk| COM port (For information on how to do initial board setup and configuration, see *Getting Started* chapter of *ARC IOT Design Kit User Guide*).

Part 2.	Lab Objectives
----------------------------

Use FXAPI and compare program run speed with and without FXAPI, i.e. DSP extension usage.

Part 3.	Lab principle and method
--------------------------------

This lab uses complex number multiplication as an example where using just compiler optimization options cannot gain the same effect as calling DSP instructions manually through FXAPI.

In this lab two implementations of complex multiplication are shown with and without FXAPI.

Complex number multiplication
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Multiplication of two complex numbers
|dsp_icon_2.1|
and
|dsp_icon_2.2|

Is done using formula:

|dsp_icon_2.3|

In this lab example multiplication and accumulation of two arrays of complex numbers are used as a way to compare performance of ARC DSP extensions when used effectively.

The sum of element wise products of two arrays of complex numbers is calculated according to the following formula:

|dsp_icon_2.4|

where a and b are arrays of N complex numbers.

Implementation without DSP
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

In order to calculate element wise products of two arrays of complex numbers, a struct can be defined that stores real and imaginary parts of the complex number. Therefore, the calculation process receives an array of structures and works on it. The code is shown below:

.. code-block:: c

    typedef struct { short real; short imag; } complex_short;

    complex_short short_complex_array_mult (complex_short *a, complex_short *b, int size) {
    	complex_short result = {0,0};
    	int acci=0;
    	int accr=0;

    	for (int i=0; i < size; i++) {
    		accr  += (int) ( a[i].real * b[i].real );
    		accr  -= (int) ( a[i].imag * b[i].imag );

    		acci  += (int) ( a[i].real * b[i].imag );
    		acci  += (int) ( a[i].imag * b[i].real );
    	}

    	result.real = (short) accr;
    	result.imag = (short) acci;

    	return result;
    }

The example keeps real and imaginary values in variables of type "short", while multiplication results are kept in "int" integer to avoid truncation. Final result is casted to short to return complex number as a result.

Implementation with FXAPI
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

FXAPI makes it possible to directly access complex number instructions (like MAC) available in ARC DSP Extensions. This is done through complex number type cq15_t, and various fx_* functions. Here ``fx_v2a40_cmac_cq15`` FXAPI function is called which performs MAC of two cq15_t complex numbers.

.. code-block:: c

    cq15_t fx_complex_array_mult(cq15_t *a, cq15_t *b, int size) {
    	v2accum40_t acc = { 0, 0 };

    	for (int i=0; i < size; i++) {
    	   acc = fx_v2a40_cmac_cq15(acc, *a++, *b++);
    	}

    	return fx_cq15_cast_v2a40( acc );
    }

As with previous implementation ``q15_t`` is of similar size as ``short`` type, therefore, multiplication result needs larger storage. Here 40b vector accumulator is used directly to store intermediate results of MAC, and is casted to ``cq15_t`` on return.

Using |iotdk| board for performance comparison
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To compare performance of these two functions a simple ESMK application is created that performs complex array multiplication using either of the implementations above. The program initializes two arrays of complex numbers with random values and calls functions above in a loop (1 000 000-10 000 000 times) to make calculation delay measurable in seconds. This is done 8 times, and after each loop a LED on board turns-on. In the result, LED strip on board works as a "progress bar" showing the process of looped multiplications.

The main performance check loop is shown in the following example. The outer loop runs 8 times (number of LEDs on LED strip), the inner loop makes "LOOPS/8" calls to complex multiplication function. LOOPS variable is configurable to change the total delay. The following example uses DSP types, and can be changed to use short-based struct type.

.. code-block:: c

    #include "fxarc.h"
    #define LOOPS 10000000
    int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
    	unsigned int led_status = 0x40 ;
    	DWCREG_PTR pctr =
             (DWCREG_PTR) (DWC_GPIO_0 | PERIPHERAL_BASE);
    	DWCREG_PTR uart =
             (DWCREG_PTR) (DWC_UART_CONSOLE | PERIPHERAL_BASE);

    	gpio_init(pctr);
    	uart_initDevice(uart, UART_CFG_BAUDRATE_115200,
               UART_CFG_DATA_8BITS,
               UART_CFG_1STOP, UART_CFG_PARITY_NONE);

    	cq15_t  cq15_a[20] = {{0x2000,10},{0x100,20},{4,30}};
    	cq15_t  cq15_b[20] = {{0x2000,11},{0x100,21},{5,31}};
    	cq15_t res;

    	uart_print(uart, "*** Start ***\n\r");

    	led_status = 0x7F;

    	for (int i =0; i< 8; i++) {
    		gpio_set_leds(pctr, led_status);
    		for (int j = 1; j < LOOPS/8; j++ ) {
    			res = fx_complex_array_mult(cq15_a, cq15_b, 2);
    		};

    		led_status = led_status >> 1;
    	}

    	gpio_set_leds(pctr, 0x01ff);
    	uart_print(uart, "*** End ***\n\r");
    	return 0;
    }

Part 4.	Test
------------

To test the following example, some modification of the code is required to have two loops with and without DSP. You must re-build libraries for this particular configuration of IOTDK:

``buildlib my_dsp -tcf=<IOTDK tcf file> -bd . -f``

|iotdk| tcf file can be found in ``embarc_osp/board/iotdk/configs/10/tcf/arcem9d.tcf``

Both examples are to be compiled with DSP extensions, with the following options set:

``gmake BOARD=iotdk BD_VER=10 CUR_CORE=arcem9d TOOLCHAIN=mw gui ADT_COPT="-Hdsplib -Xdsp2 -tcf=./arcem9d.tcf ``

  ``-Xdsp_complex" ADT_LOPT="-Hdsplib -Xdsp2 -tcf=./arcem9d.tcf -Hlib=./my_dsp"``

With high optimization level functions using "short" type is compiled to use DSP MAC operation, enabling significant speedup.

However, using FXAPI enables compiler to directly use complex MAC instruction "cmachfr".
