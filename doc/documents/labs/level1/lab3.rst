ARC features: AUX registers and timers
######################################################

Purpose
=======
- To know the auxiliary registers and processor timers of |arc|
- To learn how to program auxiliary registers to control the processor timers

Requirements
============

The following hardware and tools are required:

* PC host
* |arcgnu| / |mwdt|
* ARC board (|emsk| / |iotdk|)
* ``embarc_osp/arc_labs/labs/lab_timer``

Content
========

- Through reading the corresponding Build Configuration Register (BCR) auxiliary registers of processor timers to get the configuration information
- Through programming the auxiliary registers to initialize, start and stop the timer (here TIMER0 is used)
- By reading the count value of processor timers, get the execution time of a code block

Principles
==========

Auxiliary Registers
-------------------

The auxiliary register set contains status and control registers, which by default are 32 bits wide to implement the processor control, for example, interrupt and exception management and processor timers. These
auxiliary registers occupy a separate 32-bit address space from the normal memory-access (that is load and
store) instructions. Auxiliary registers accessed using distinct Load Register (LR), Store Register (SR), and
Auxiliary EXchange (AEX) instructions.

The auxiliary register address region 0x60 up to 0x7F and region 0xC0 up to 0xFF is reserved for the Build
Configuration Registers (BCRs) that can be used by embedded software or host debug software to detect the
configuration of the ARCv2-based hardware. The Build Configuration Registers contain the version of each
ARCv2-based extension and also the build-specific configuration information.

In |embarc|, ``arc_builtin.h`` provides API (**_arc_aux_read** and **_arc_aux_read**) to access the auxiliary registers.


Processor Timers
----------------

The processor timers are two independent 32-bit timers and a 64-bit real-time
counter (RTC). **Timer0** and **Timer1** are identical in operation. The only
difference is that these timers are connected to different interrupts. The
timers cannot be included in a configuration without interrupts. Each timer is
optional and when present, it is connected to a fixed interrupt; interrupt 16
for timer 0 and interrupt 17 for timer 1.

The processor timers are connected to a system clock signal that operates even
when the ARCv2-based processor is in the sleep state. The timers can be used
to generate interrupt signals that wake the processor from the SLEEP state. The
processor timers automatically reset and restart their operation after
reaching the limit value. The processor timers can be programmed to count only
the clock cycles when the processor is not halted. The processor timers can
also be programmed to generate an interrupt or to generate a system Reset upon
reaching the limit value. The 64-bit RTC does not generate any interrupts.
This timer is used to count the clock cycles atomically.

Through the BCR register *0x75*, you can get the configuration information of processor timers

In |embarc|, ``arc_timer.h`` provides API to operate the processor timers.

Program flow chart
------------------

The code's flow is shown below:

.. image:: /img/lab3_program_flow_chart.png
    :alt: program flow chart

The code can be divided into 3 parts:

* Part1 : read the BCR of internal timers to check the features
* Part2 : promgram Timer0 by auxiliary registers with the |embarc| provided API
* Part3 : read the counts to Timer 0 to measure a code block's execution time

Steps
=====

1. Build and Run

.. code-block:: console

    $ cd <embarc_root>/arc_labs/labs/lab_timer
    # for emsk
    $ make BOARD=emsk BD_VER=22 CUR_CORE=arcem7d TOOLCHAIN=gnu run
    # for iotdk
    $ make BOARD=iotdk TOOLCHAIN=gnu run

2. Output

.. code-block:: console
