How to use ARC IDE
======================

|mwdt|
------

Purpose
^^^^^^^^

* To learn |mwdt|
* To get familiar with the basic usage of the |mwdt|
* To get familiar with the features and usage of the MetaWare Debugger (mdb)

Requirements
^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following hardware and tools are required:

* PC host
* |mwdt|
* nSIM simulator or ARC board (|emsk| / |iotdk|)
* ``embarc_osp/arc_labs/labs/lab_core_test``

Content
^^^^^^^^^

* Create a C project using the |mwdt|
* Import the code ``CoreTest.c`` from ``embarc_osp/arc_labs/labs/lab_core_test``
* Configure compilation options to compile, and generate executable files.
* Start the debugger of |mwdt| and enter debug mode.

From the different angles of C language and assembly language, use the functions of setting breakpoint, single step execution, full speed execution, and so on combined with observing PC address, register status, global variable status, and profiling performance to analyze and debug the target program.


Principles
^^^^^^^^^^^

Use the |mwdt| to create projects and load code. In the engineering unit, configure the compilation options to compile code, debug, and analyze the compiled executable file.

Routine code CoreTest.c:

.. code-block:: c

    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////
    // This small demo program finds the data point that is the
    // minimal distance from x and y [here arbitrarily defined to be (4,5)]
    //
    // #define/undefine '_DEBUG' precompiler variable to obtain
    // desired functionality. Including _DEBUG will bring in the
    // I/O library to print results of the search.
    //
    // For purposes of simplicity, the data points used in the computations
    // are hardcoded into the POINTX and POINTY constant values below
    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


    #ifdef _DEBUG
    #include "stdio.h"
    #endif

    #define POINTX {1, 2, 3, 4,  5,  6,  7,  8,  9, 10}
    #define POINTY {2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20}
    #define POINTS 10

    #define GetError(x, y, Px, Py) \
    	( (x-Px)*(x-Px) + (y-Py)*(y-Py) )

    int main(int argc, char* argv[]) {
    	int pPointX[] = POINTX;
    	int pPointY[] = POINTY;

    	int x, y;
    	int index, error, minindex, minerror;

    	x = 4;
    	y = 5;

    	minerror = GetError(x, y, pPointX[0], pPointY[0]);
    	minindex = 0;

    	for(index = 1; index < POINTS; index++) {
		error = GetError(x, y, pPointX[index], pPointY[index]);

    		if (error < minerror) {
    			minerror = error;
    			minindex = index;
                }
            }

    #ifdef _DEBUG
    	printf("minindex = %d, minerror = %d.\n", minindex, minerror);
    	printf("The point is (%d, %d).\n", pPointX[minindex], pPointY[minindex]);
    	getchar();
    #endif

    	return 0;
        }


Steps
^^^^^^

1. Create a project

Open the |mwdt|, create an empty project called ``demo``, and select the **ARC EM Generic** processor.

|figure1|

2. Import the code file CoreTest.c to the project ``demo``.

In the Project Explorer, click |icon1| and select **Import**.

Import dialog box is displayed. Select the File System item from the **General** tab, and click **Next**. As shown in the following figure, add the file directory where the source code CoreTest.c is located. The dialog box automatically displays the name of the directory and the file name of the file contained in the directory. Select CoreTest.c and click **Finish** to complete the import process.

|figure2|

After the import is complete, you can see the code file ``CoreTest.c`` you just added in the Project Explorer on the left side of the |mwdt| main interface.

3. Set compilation options

Right-click in the current project demo and select Properties. Click **C/C++ Build** > **Settings** > **Tool Settings** to open the compilation options settings window.

|figure3|

Select **Optimization/Debugging** to set the compiler
optimization and debugging level. For example, set the optimization level to
turn off optimization, and set the debugging level to load all debugging
information.

Select Processor/Extensions to set the compilation options corresponding to the target processor hardware properties, such as the
version of the processor, whether to support extended instructions such as
shift, multiplication, floating-point operations, and so on whether to include
Timer0/1. As shown in the following figure, this setting indicates that the target
processor supports common extended instructions.

|figure4|

Select **MetaWare ARC EM C/C++** and check the settings compilation options and click **OK**.

4. Compile project demo

Select Build Project from the Project drop-down menu in the |mwdt| main menu
or click the icon |icon2| . In the |mwdt| main interface, select **Console**
to view the logs during compilation. When the message "Finished building
target: demo.elf" is displayed, the compilation is successful, and the
compiled executable file demo.elf can be seen in the Project Explorer.

|figure5|

5. Set debug options

Select Debug Configurations from the **Run** drop-down menu and double-click **C/C++ Application** or right-click **New**

|figure6|

Click **Debugger**. You do not need to make any changes. Check the contents of the Debugger Options, click **Debug** to enter the debugging interface.

6. Debug executable file demo.elf

Select the required debug window from the main menu of the debug interface, such as source code window, assembly code
window, register window, global variable window, breakpoint window, function
window, and so on.

|figure7|

In the C code window, right-click the code line number on the left side of the
window, select **Toggle Breakpoint** or double-click the line
number to set a breakpoint on the current line. In the assembly code window,
double-click a line of code to set a breakpoint on the current line.

After the breakpoint is set, click |icon3| to run the program. The program runs directly to the nearest breakpoint. You can observe the current program execution and the relevant status
information of the processor through the various windows as described in previous step. If you want to know more about the details of program execution
and the instruction behavior of the processor, you can use the following three
execution commands |icon4| to perform single-step debugging. The icon |icon5|
can choose to step through a C language statement or an assembly instruction
to match the status information of each window. It can be very convenient for
program debugging. If you want to end the current debugging process, click |icon6| . If you want to return to the main |mwdt| page, click C/C++
|icon7|.

7. Code performance analysis using the debugger

Based on the previous project demo, open the **Compile Options** dialog box in step 3
and set the Optimization Level to -O0 in the **Optimization/Debugging** column.
Then click |icon8| to recompile the project, and click |icon9| to enter the
debugging interface. Click **Debugger** in the main menu of the debugging
interface, select **Disassembly** from the menu drop-down menu, open the
disassembly code window, and you can see that the program is paused at the
entrance of the main() function. In the same way, select **Profiling** in the
**Debugger** drop-down menu, open the performance analysis window and click |icon10|.

|figure8|

The **Profiling** window displays the corresponding of the number of executed
instructions of the program with each function under the current debug window.
From left to right, the total number of executions of function instructions in
the total number of executions of the entire program instruction, the total
number of executions of the accumulated instructions, the total number of
executions of the functions, the number of times the function is called, the
number of including functions, the address of the function, and the name of
the function. Through the relationship between the instruction information and
the function in the Profiling window, it is very convenient to analyze the
program efficiency and find the shortcoming of the program performance.

Use this project as an example to continue to introduce the use of the
Profiling window. The program is paused at the entrance of the
main() function and the Profiling window opens. The main()
function is the main object of performance analysis optimization. The content displayed in the Profiling window is some function
information initialized by the processor before the main() function is
executed. Click |icon11| in the Profiling window to clear the current
information. If you click |icon12|, nothing is displayed,
and it indicates that the cleaning is successful. Set a breakpoint at the
last statement of the main() function (either C statement or assembly
statement), and click |icon13| in the toolbar above the debug
interface to let the program execute to the breakpoint. Click |icon14| in the Profiling window, and only the information related
to the main() function is displayed. Therefore, flexible
setting of breakpoints, combined with the clear function, can perform
performance analysis on the concerned blocks.

|figure9|

It can be seen that the multiplication library function _mw_mpy_32x32y32 in
the main() function is called 20 times, and a total of 2064 instructions are
executed, while the main() function itself executes only 326 instructions, and
the memcpy function executes 86 instructions. It can be seen that the
implementation of the multiplication function of the program consumes a large
number of instructions, and the large number of instructions means that the
processor spends a large number of computation cycles to perform
multiplication operations. Therefore, multiplication is the shortcoming of
current program performance. If you want to improve the performance of the
program, you should consider how you can use fewer instructions and
implement multiplication more efficiently.

Exercises
^^^^^^^^^^

Enable MPY extension instrctions by setting Multiply Option -Xmpy_option = wlh1 in step 3, it will implement multiplication more efficiently with fewer instructions.
Redo step 4 - 7 to analyze with the debugger's Profiling function, observe the total number of instructions consumed by the main function, and compare it with the above Profiling result.

|arcgnu|
-------------------

Purpose
^^^^^^^^^^

* Learn the |arcgnu|
* Familiar with the |arcgnu|
* Familiar with the functions and usage of the |arcgnu| debugger

Equipment
^^^^^^^^^

The following hardware and tools are required:

* PC host
* |arcgnu|
* nSIM simulator or ARC board (|emsk| / |iotdk|)
* ``embarc_osp/arc_labs/labs/lab_core_test``

Content
^^^^^^^^^^^

* Create a C project using |arcgnu|
* Import the code ``CoreTest.c`` from ``embarc_osp/arc_labs/labs/lab_core_test``
* Configure compilation options to compile, and generate executable files.
* Start the |arcgnu| debugger to enter the debug mode

From the C language and assembly language different perspectives, use set breakpoints, single-step execution, full-speed execution and other functions, combined with observation of PC address, register status, global variable status and Profiling Performance analysis window, analysis of the debug target program.

Principles
^^^^^^^^^^

Use the |arcgnu| integrated development environment to create projects and load routine code. In the engineering unit, configure the compile option compilation routine code to debug and analyze the compiled executable file.

Steps
^^^^^

1. Establishing a project

Open the |arcgnu|, create an empty project called core_test, and select **ARC EM series processor**.

|figure10|

2. Import the code file CoreTest.c to the project demo

Right-click |icon15|, and then select **Import**.

Import dialog box is displayed. Select **File System** from the
the **General** tab, and click **Next**. As shown in the following figure,
add the file directory where the source code CoreTest.c is located. The dialog
box automatically displays the name of the directory and the file name of
the file contained in the directory. Select the file to be added, CoreTest.c,
and click Finish to complete the entire import process.

|figure11|

After the import is complete, you can see the code file CoreTest.c that you
just added in the Project Explorer.

3. Set compilation options

Right-click in the current project core_test and select **Properties**. Click **C/C++ Build** > **Settings** > **Tool Settings** to view the compile option settings page.

|figure12|

Select **Debugging** to set the compiler optimization
and debugging level. For example, set the optimization level to off
optimization, and the debugging level is to load all debugging information.

Select Processor in the current interface to set the compile options
corresponding to the target processor hardware attributes, such as the version
of the processor, whether to support extended instructions such as shift,
multiplication, floating-point operations, and so on whether to include Timer0/1.

In step 1, you already built the project using the engineering template of
EMSK, the corresponding necessary options have been set by default. If
there is no special requirement, check the setting compile options in the All
options column and click **OK** to close the Properties dialog box.

4. Compile the project core_test

Select **Build Project** from the Project drop-down menu in the |arcgnu| main menu
or click |icon16|. In the middle of the |arcgnu| main interface,
select Console to view the logs during the compilation process. When
the message "Finished building target: Core_test.elf" is displayed, the compilation
is successful, and the compiled executable file Core_test.elf can be seen in
the **Project Explorer** as shown in the following figure.

|figure13|

5. Set debugger options

Select Debug Configurations from the Run drop-down menu in the main menu. Then
double-click in C/C++ Application or right-click **New** to get a dialog box
similar to the one shown in the following figure.

|figure14|

Check if the information in Main is correct. As you use nSIM simulator to simulate EMSK development board, you need to
modify the settings of Debugger, Common, and Terminal (this is because nSIM
cannot be called directly in GNU IDE. Still need GDB Server for indirect
calls). The specific settings are as follows:

* Set Debugger->Gdbsrever Settings

|figure15|

The ARC GDB Server should select nSIM. The port number default setting is 49105. It is important to check the Use TCF. Otherwise, the nSIM cannot work normally. The TCF start file is under *nSIM/nSIM/etc/tcf/templates* (the default installation path). If you have downloaded the MetaWare IDE, the default nSIM path is *C:/ARC/nSIM/nSIM/etc/tcf/templates*, and you can select a TCF file from this folder (depending on the version of the board you are simulating and the kernel model), as shown earlier.

* Pay attention to Debug in Common

|figure16|

* Terminal settings

If you are using the |emsk|, the terminal automatically selects the correct port number, and you are using the emulator without a port, uncheck it, as show in the following figure.

|figure17|

After all settings are completed, click **Debug** to enter the debugging interface.

6. Debug executable file core_test.elf

Select the required debug window from the Debugger menu in the
main menu of the debug interface, such as source code window, assembly code
window, register window, global variable window, breakpoint window, function
window, and so on as shown in the following figure.

|figure18|

In the C code window, right-click the code line number on the left side of the
window, select **Toggle Breakpoint** or double-click the line
number to set a breakpoint on the current line. In the assembly code window,
double-click a line of code to set a breakpoint on the current line.

After the breakpoint is set, click |icon3| to run the program. The program runs directly to the nearest breakpoint. You can observe the current program execution and the relevant status
information of the processor through the various windows as described in previous step. If you want to know more about the details of program execution
and the instruction behavior of the processor, you can use the following three
execution commands |icon4| to perform single-step debugging. The icon |icon5|
can choose to step through a C language statement or an assembly instruction
to match the status information of each window. It can be very convenient for
program debugging. If you want to end the current debugging process, click |icon6| . If you want to return to the main |mwdt| page, click C/C++
|icon7|.

7. Code performance analysis using the debugger

Same as the code performance analysis method of |mwdt|.

For the use of these two IDEs, you can refer to the Help documentation in the respective IDE, or you can view the on-line documentation provided by Synopsys.
